**Professor in ML/AI at [ISAE-SUPAERO](www.isae-supaero.fr)**,  
**Team leader of the [Supaero Reinforcement Learning Initiative (SuReLI)](https://sureli.github.io)**.  

My research lies in the fields of Reinforcement Learning and Sequential Decision problems, with a broader interest for Machine Learning and Operations Research.  
Above all, I like to deeply understand the mechanisms of learning and optimization.  
I like inspiring and diverse applications that fuel my research and challenge my comfort zone. 

I love teaching and education, but I'm not a big fan of grading.  
I like the principle of [slow science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_science).
